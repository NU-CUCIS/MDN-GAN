# A General Framework Combining Generative Adversarial Networks and Mixture Density Networks for Inverse Modeling in Microstructural Materials Design
This software is an application of a general framework combining generative adversarial networks and mixture density networks for inverse modeling in microstructural materials design. The efficacy of the proposed approach is tested on a case study where material microstructure is design given a desired optical matieral property. 

To use this software, what the algorithm requires as input is a float number from 0 to 1 representing the value for optical matrial property. Then the mixture density networks will sample various latent variable vectors, following by generative adversarial networks to produce designed microstructure images. The detailed drscription about architecture and training processing of the proposed framework can be found in the published paper given below.
