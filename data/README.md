For each hdf5 file, it contains three datasets: 'z' contains the datasets of latent variables of generative adversarial networks (GAN), 'x' contains the datasets of microstructure images generated by GAN using 'z', 'y' contains the optical absorption property simulated using 'x'. 

dataset_z9.hdf5: the size of microstructure image 'x' and the latent variables 'z' are 96x96 and 3x3, respectively.

dataset_z4.hdf5: the size of microstructure image 'x' and the latent variables 'z' are 64x64 and 2x2, respectively.

Note that 100 examples of each dataset are uploaded due to the size of dataset.
